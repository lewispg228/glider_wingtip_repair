# glider_wingtip_repair

I bought a Araine fiberglass glider on RCgroups. Unfortunately, during shipment, both of the wing tips were smashed. In this repo, I intend to document the reapir process.

I think it's gonna need a jig.

My plan is to scan in the wing. Create a jig, which will consist of two peices of lazer cut acrylic with "pin holes" in specific places.

With this jig, I can set the length of positioning pins and really hold the wing straight while the epoxy/fiber mix cures.

Here it goes.
